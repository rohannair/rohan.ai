# Welcome

This is my personal website. It's built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and ingenuity. It runs on [Bun](https://bun.sh). It's got a 100% score on Lighthouse:

There are some other technologies as well:
* [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) for a faster Tailwind runtie
* [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) for Markdown syntax highlighting
