I'm going to talk about coding, startups, and occasionally veer off into random misc. stuff. A lot of random opinions coming such as:
- Coding
  - Typescript stuff
  - Elixir stuff
  - Applied AI stuff
  - Machine learning stuff
  - React world stuff
  - API stuff
- Startups
  - Early stage validation
  - The dumb shit I've endured in my career (there is a LOT)
  - How to build teams

Stay tuned!
