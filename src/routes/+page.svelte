  Hi, I'm Rohan
</h1>

<p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
  I've spent over {new Date().getFullYear() - 2010} years in the Toronto technology
  and startup ecosystem, working at and founding multiple startups.
</p>
<p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
  Currently, I help investors and business owners cut through the AI hype to build products that actually work. I also sparingly invest in and advise early-stage software companies.
</p>

  Current Work
</h2>
<ul class="space-y-3">
  <li class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
    <strong class="text-blue-500">Fractional CTO</strong>. Bringing professional engineering practices to growing startups without killing their momentum.
  </li>
  <li class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
    <strong class="text-green-400">Software Architecture</strong>. Designing scalable, data-heavy systems that survive contact with the real world.
  </li>
  <li class="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
    <strong class="text-yellow-400">Advisory Services</strong>. Helping founders avoid the expensive technical mistakes I've seen dozens of times before.
  </li>
</ul>

  Technical Sweet Spot
</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
  <p>
    I gravitate towards complex data engineering challenges and UI-heavy projects where user experience is the differentiator.
  </p>
  <p>
    My best work involves using LLMs to tame massive amounts of unstructured data into succinct, meaningful interfaces that make complex systems feel simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a soft spot for <strong class="text-gray-100">FinTech</strong>, <strong class="text-gray-100">Healthcare</strong>, and <strong class="text-gray-100">Spatial Computing</strong>—high-stakes industries where accuracy actually matters.

  Focus & Thesis
</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
  <p>
    I invest in and advise <strong class="text-gray-100">DeepTech</strong> and <strong class="text-gray-100">HardTech</strong> startups, because I prefer engineering challenges over marketing ones. I also help companies build <strong class="text-gray-100">LLM architectures</strong> that move beyond "cool demo" to reliable production systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a public market investor in <strong class="text-gray-100">semiconductor companies</strong>. Which really just means a lot of my emotions are based on Nvidia's earnings.
