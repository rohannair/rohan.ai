<h1 class="text-4xl antialiased">Hi, I'm Rohan</h1>

<p class="text-lg leading-8">
  I've spent over {new Date().getFullYear() - 2010} years in the Toronto technology
  and startup ecosystem working at and founding multiple startups.
</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-8">
  I'm currently helping investors and small-business owners understand how to
  fit AI products into their business. I also sparingly invest in, and advise
  early stage software companies.

<h2>Core Interests</h2>

    experimenting with LLM technologies such as RAG to build myself an LLM that
    acts as a true daily assistant.

  <li class="text-lg leading-8 mb-4">
    <strong class="text-green-400">AI-driven operations</strong>, specifically

    fandom.
